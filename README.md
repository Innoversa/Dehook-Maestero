## Repository Description 

- `kaggle_fraud_email.csv`: We downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llabhishekll/fraud-email-dataset).

Most emails are originally sent between 1998 - 2007 (which is not very representative of fraud emails nowadays). Thus this dataset will serve as a pre-training dataset for our framework.
